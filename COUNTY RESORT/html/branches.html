<h1 bgColor="green" color="red">The Cape County Resort - Cape Town, South Africa</h1>
<p>County Resort is the only luxury Cape Town hotel located within Table Mountain National Park: at the base of precipitous
Chapmans Peak, it is also the only hotel in the city that is right on the beach and offers sublime ocean views,
excellent food and authentic, warm service.</p>
<img src="Seasons.jpg" width="880"height="350">
<h2>Facilities</h2>
<p>Fancy a day flopped by the pool? Grab your pool bag from the closet and get settled in; theres even sunscreen and water
to be sourced from the woven bags dotted around the terrace. For those with a little more motivation, theres Virgin
Active gym passes on offer from reception, who are on-hand 24 hours a day - its rather like having a brilliant
concierge service.</p>
<img src="pool.jpg" width="880" height="350">
<h2>Food and drink</h2>
<p>The breakfast at County Resort is quite possibly the best start to the day you might ever have. Lavish (go for at least
two courses), and also included in your room rate, it's served at any time of day, and if youre feeling particularly
lazy (or are still recovering from a Table Mountain hike), theyre also happy to bring it to your room. Theres a full
bar service, including a cocktail list and wine list, as well as a limited but seasonally based menu.</p>
<img src="bar1.jpg" width="800"height="350">
<h2>Extra-Curricular</h2>
<p>County Resort is ideally placed if you want to hit one of the Table Mountain trails early doors, but make sure you keep
an eye on the weather: brisk south-easterly winds often usher in a fog-like blanket, the tablecloth that settles along
the flat top, and shuts down the cable car that also shuttles people up and down. Sunrise hikes along Lions Head, which
sits next to Table Mountain with views down the Atlantic Seaboard, are a must, according to locals.</p>
